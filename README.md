# Boid Simulation
This project simulates a flock of boids (bird-like agents) that follow simple rules to create complex swarm behavior.  
You can adjust their behavior, visualize them as prism-shaped polygons, and observe emergent patterns. Writen in Python(pygame)

### ✅ Features
- Boids steer using alignment, cohesion and separation
- Adjustable speed and turning angle
- Drawn as asymmetric prism-like triangles
- Easy to customize and expand

### ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pygame (`pip install pygame`)

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```
